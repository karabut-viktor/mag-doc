\section{Conclusion and Future Work}

During this work we developed framework for finding similar code in Java project.
We  managed to give the formal definition of a similar code fragments using intermediate code representation ACT.
Developed during this work translator allows to convert arbitrary Java 1.7 code into ACT.
As ACT is a language agnostic representation this is possible to implement support for another languages.

In future work I plan is to parse multiple open source project from Maven central.
Final goal is to implement extension for some IDE(Integrated Development Environment) which would find similar code
fragments from maven in reasonable time.
