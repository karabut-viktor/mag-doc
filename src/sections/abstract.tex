Goal of this work is to develop a software system that finds similar code for specific Java code fragment.
During this work we use convert code into intermediate representation - ACT (approximate code tree) and give a formal definition of code similarity in terms of ACTs.
Using this definition we can compute how similar two Java code fragments in scale from 0 to 1.
However one to one comparisons requires quadratic time and doesn't suitable for big code bases.
To improve search performance we implement ACT search engine.
Search engine hashes ACT and searches for similar code in the database of fingerprinted, versioned and indexed ACTs.
