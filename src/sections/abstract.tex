\begin{abstract}
Goal of this work is develop computer system that predicts possible improvements
for specific Java code fragment. System parses Java method into ACT (approximate code trees) 
fingerprints and searches for similar code from database of fingerprinted, versioned and indexed 
OSS (open source software) projects. During this work I plan to obtains OSS code from Maven 
Central and construct chains of versioned ACT fingerprints. After that develop search engine 
for finding similar code in fingerprint database.
