\section{Similar code detection}

In this work we use pure syntactic methods to determine 'equivalent' or 'similar'
code. Simplest possible way to do this would be line-by-line comparison of
source lines. However code can differ by an indentation, comments, variable names
and etc. Closer to full semantics but sill practical possibility would be to
compare program representation in which control and data flows are explicit.

At first step of similar code detection we parse code into Abstract Syntax
trees. Rather than comparing trees for exact equality, we compare by similarity
scoring function\cite{Baxter&al1998}:


\begin{math}
Similarity =  \frac{ 2 \cdot S}{2 \cdot S + L + R}
\end{math}

S is a number of shared nodes. L is a number of different nodes in left subtree,
and R - in right subtree.
